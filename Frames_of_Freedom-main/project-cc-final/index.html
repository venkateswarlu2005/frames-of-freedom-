India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India.</p>

                  <p>Some proportion of DNA sequence of every individual is unique. There are probes that can find such unique DNA sequences and generate individual-specific DNA profile. This can be visualized as bands by molecular biology techniques. In 1988, CSIR-CCMB scientists developed indigenous probes for DNA fingerprinting and took this technique to the users. India, thus, became the third country in the world to develop its own DNA fingerprinting probe.</p>

Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.</p>
