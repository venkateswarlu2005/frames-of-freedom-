        <p class="Intro">Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India 
            commemorating the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when 
            the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the 
            Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until 
            its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 
            (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the 
            enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the 
            independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.</p>
